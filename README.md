Immerse your players in a more realistic and engaging experience with our custom script for FiveM, "Immersive Collision Dynamics." This script goes beyond the traditional mechanics of prop loss when a player is hit by another, introducing a new level of immersion to your server.

# Key Features:

This heightened sense of realism contributes to a more authentic gaming experience, allowing players to focus on their interactions and activities without the distraction of sudden prop loss.

Our script is optimized for server-side performance, ensuring that it seamlessly integrates into your existing FiveM server without causing disruptions. Enjoy the benefits of enhanced immersion without compromising the overall stability and performance of your server.

**Community Feedback Integration:**
We value the input of the FiveM community. As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, we encourage server administrators and players to provide feedback on their experience with Immersive Collision Dynamics. This collaborative approach allows us to refine and enhance the script based on real-world usage.
